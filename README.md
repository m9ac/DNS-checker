This project is meant to help with DNS testing

There are  2 python scripts to choose from
    dns_test.py is the simpler of the two, where dns_test2.py is a bit more involved and interactive

There is a known issue with the following line in both scripts:
    query = resolver.query("example.com")

I welcom anyone to help out with that issue, but becasue everything still just works, I am not to fussed about the error and have no plans on reworking the scripts just to avoid the issue ... for now

enjoy, and if you are so inclined, buy me a coffee for the effort. https://mtnsolutions.pro/coffee/
